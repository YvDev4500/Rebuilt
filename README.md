# Rebuilt
hello everyone i am yv and i'm gonna rebuild my scripts because my computer just got clear up so all of my 1.2 year hardwork are gone

WARNING. this script was an story and some scripts 

The unbecoming of mara-dyer

A trainer

My name is not Mata Dyer, but my 
lawyertold me i had to choose some-
thing. A pseudonym. A nom de plume,
for all of us studying for the SATs.
I know that having a fake name is 
strange, but trust me--it's the most
normal thing about my life right now.
Even telling you this much probably 
isn't smart. But without my big mouth,
no one would know that a seventeen-
year-old who likes Death Cab for Cutie 
was responsible for the murders. No
one would know that somewhere out 
there is a B student with a body count.
And it's important that you know, so 
your're not next.
  Rachel's birthday was the beginning.
This is what i remember.


                        "Mara Dyer"
             [Redacted], New York City
                        Date [Redacted]

╚══██╔══╝HE ORNATE SCRIPT ON THE BOARD TWISTED
░░░██║░░░in the candlelight. making the latters and num-
░░░██║░░░bers dance in my head. They were jumbled and 
░░░╚═╝░░░indistinct, like alphabet soup. When Claire
pushed the heart-shaped piece into my hand, i startled.
I wasn't normally so twitchy, and hoped Rachel wouldn't 
notice. The Oujia board was her favorite present that night,
and Claire gave it to her. I got her a bracelet. She wasn't 
wearing it.
  Kneeling on the carpet, i passed the piece to Rachel. Claire
shook her head, oozing disdain. Rachel put down the piece.
  "It's just a game, Mara." She smiled, her teeth looking even 
whiter in the dim light. Rachel and i had been best friends

Page-2

since preschool, and where she was dark and wild, i was pale
and cautious. But less so when we were together. She made me
feel bold. Usually.
  "I don't have anything to ask dead people," i said to her.
And at sixteen, we're too old for this. i didn't say.
  "Ask whether Jude will ever like you back."
  Claire's voice was innocent, but i knew better. My cheeks
flamed, but i stifled the urge to snap at her and laughed it off.
"Can i ask it for a car? Is this like a dead Santa scenario?"
  "Actually, since it's my birthday, i'm going first." Rachel put
her fingers on the piece. Claire and i followed her.
  "Oh! Rachel, ask it how you're going to die."
